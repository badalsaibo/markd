## Live Demo ðŸš€
[badalsaibo.github.io/markd](https://badalsaibo.github.io/markd/)

## Introduction ðŸ—’
M A R K D is a pretty simple markdown preview I created on React to learn about shared state.
Wireframing for the site was done on Figma.

## Setup ðŸ› 
The setup is pretty minimal. 
It loads React in a script tag, and uses [Marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) for parsing the markdown. 

You can clone the repository, `cd` into it and start a [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server).
